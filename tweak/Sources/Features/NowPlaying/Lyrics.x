// The lyrics card under the player and the page it expands into, both on glass.
//
// Card (trees/now-playing.txt): a Lyrics_CardElementImpl.CardView inside an
// Element_List.CollectionViewCell 370x316. The cell is the painted surface with the 16pt corners,
// so the pane fills it and the cell's own clipping cuts the corners.
//
// Page (trees/lyrics.txt): a page of its own, presented over the player by a
// _UIOverFullscreenPresentationController, which is why the card's glass stops at the card's edge.
// Tome_PageTemplateImpl paints the template view #121212 and FullscreenView paints itself the
// album colour on top, both opaque; clearing them lets the player's blurred artwork through, so
// the card reads as having grown to the screen.
//
// The album colour is the stubborn one: it arrives per track, after the page has laid out, and it
// comes back through a path Appearance/Repaint.x never sees, so a sweep at layout time loses the race.
// FullscreenView is asked not to keep it at all instead. The pane goes inside FullscreenView, in
// front of whatever that view still fills itself with, rather than behind the whole page.
