# Working on the mod

## Layout

    tweak/src/ui/*.x   the tweaks: NowPlayingBar, TabBar, Navbar, NowPlayingView, Lyrics, SearchField, Flags, Amoled, HomeGradient, Declutter, Playlist, Repaint, Settings
    tweak/src/SG*      shared helpers (glass panes, view walking, logging, screen dumps) and SGPrivacy, the telemetry blocking
    scripts/           pipeline.sh (build + inject), install.sh (sign + install), record-trees.py, dump-log.sh, extract-flags.py
    trees/             recorded view trees, one per screen; the input for every new tweak
    plist/             Info.plist overrides merged into the app (turns UIDesignRequiresCompatibility off)
    vendor/            AutoFLEX deb
    ipa/, out/         decrypted Spotify IPA in, built IPAs out (both gitignored)

`tweak/src/SGFlagList.m` is generated from the IPA and gitignored, as are the recorded trees: both
are read out of Spotify's own binary and belong to whoever built them.

## Make targets

    make build      # out/Spotify-<version>-glass.ipa with FLEX in it
    make release    # the same without FLEX
    make install    # build without FLEX, sign with your certificate, install over USB
    make install FLEX=1   # the same with FLEX, which is what make trees reads through
    make trees      # record view trees screen by screen (FLEX build open on the phone, USB)
    make log        # stream [spotifyglass] log lines from the phone
    make flags      # regenerate tweak/src/SGFlagList.m from the IPA

## Mod Settings

Settings → Mod Settings lists its pages without a description each, so the list reads as a list: UI
Tweaks (tab bar, search field, Spotify's own glass, AMOLED), Home & Library (a gradient background,
hide sections of the Home tab, Spotify's home and library flags), Playlist (hide the cover, the
header's text and buttons, the curation pills), Now Playing (glass, Spotify's player flags, hide
buttons and cards of the full screen player, and a Lyrics page under it), Lock screen widget,
Playback (speed, queue, the player and the now playing bar), Ads & nags (every switch forces a flag
Spotify ships on to off: the ad on app open, upsells, tooltips, the DJ badge), Unreleased (features
Spotify built and did not ship) and Experimental, which holds AI Chat (Martini). Then Privacy,
telemetry blocking with a count of what it has stopped; Navbar, the tab bar's own composition; and
All flags, Spotify's remote-config flags with a search field and an Auto / Off / On control per flag
(a text field for the number and text ones). A flag switch on a page forces that one flag and off
leaves Spotify's own value, so the All flags page is where a flag goes back to Auto. Spotify ships
its newer design behind several flags at once, so UI Tweaks > Spotify's own Liquid Glass owns them
(the glass navigation bar, the new player slider, the sheet style player, the queue and Connect
sheets, the redesigned player header, the sleep timer's options sheet): while it is on it forces
each of them, and their rows elsewhere show what it forces and take no touch, so the group has one
switch. `SGGlassOwnsFlag` in SGCommon.m holds the list. A change shows after Spotify restarts.

Navbar is the exception and applies as soon as the bar lays out again. It lists the tabs in the order
the bar shows them: drag to reorder, tap to hide or show, and Add a tab puts a page of Spotify's or
any `spotify:` link on the bar with one of Encore's own glyphs. Spotify's own tabs are kept by the
name under their icon, so they can be hidden but never removed, and switching the app's language
starts the order over. A tab of the mod's own opens its link through Spotify's link dispatcher, so it
never lights up as the tab you are on.

## Adding a tweak

1. `make trees`, record the screen, read `trees/<screen>.txt` for the classes and frames.
2. Add `tweak/src/ui/<Area>.x`: hook the classes, use `SGGlassFor`/`SGGlassAt` + `SGShapeGlass` for
   glass, `SGStripBackgrounds` to clear Spotify's paint, and end with `%ctor { %init; SGRequireClasses(...); }`.
3. `make install`. Log lines are prefixed `[spotifyglass]`. A FLEX build serves the visible screen's
   tree on the phone's port 8085, which `make trees` reaches over USB through iproxy.
