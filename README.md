# spotifyglass

Liquid Glass UI for the Spotify iOS app. A Theos tweak, one dylib, is injected into a decrypted
Spotify IPA and signed with your own certificate, so it runs on a stock iPhone with no jailbreak.
Settings → Mod Settings turns every piece on and off: glass on the tab bar, the player and the
search field, an AMOLED black theme, a Home gradient, hiding whatever a screen does not need,
telemetry blocking, a tab bar you can reorder, and Spotify's own remote-config flags.

No IPA is distributed here. You bring a decrypted Spotify IPA of your own and build on your machine.

## Build

A Mac with Theos in `~/theos` and an iPhoneOS SDK in `~/theos/sdks`, plus:

    brew install make ldid dpkg zsign ideviceinstaller libimobiledevice
    uv tool install "cyan @ git+https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw"

Put a decrypted Spotify `.ipa` in `ipa/`, then:

    make release    # out/Spotify-<version>-glass.ipa, ready to sign
    make install    # the same, signed with your certificate and pushed to the iPhone over USB

`make install` reads `SIGN_P12`, `SIGN_PROFILE` and `SIGN_P12_PASSWORD` from `.signing.env`; copy
`.signing.env.example` and fill it in. The app is re-identified as `com.spotify.client2`, so it
installs next to the real Spotify rather than over it (`BUNDLE_ID=` overrides).

The first build spends about a minute reading Spotify's remote-config flags out of your IPA into
`tweak/src/SGFlagList.m`. Later builds reuse it; `make flags` regenerates it.

## Build on GitHub instead

No Mac needed. Fork this repo, enable Actions in the fork, and run the **Build IPA from your own
Spotify IPA** workflow. It asks for a direct link to your decrypted Spotify `.ipa` (filebin.net,
Dropbox, a file host of your own), builds the tweak, injects it, and hands back an unsigned
`Spotify-<version>-glass.ipa` as a workflow artifact, or on filebin.net if you pick that. Sign it
with SideStore, Feather or any certificate signer.

The IPA link is masked in the run's log, and the result lives only in your fork.
